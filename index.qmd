### Who Locates Where

* Classical *Urban* question
* Want to apply that in several domains:
::: 

::: {.column width=45%}

::: {.callout-tip}

# 1. Parents
*Where* do parents have children?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}

# 2. Family Networks
*How* does the family network affect location choices?
:::

::: {.callout-tip}

# 3. Bus Operators
*How* do firms locate in space to avoid competition?

# 1. Fertility, Housing Costs and City Growth

## Fertility, Housing Costs and City Growth


1. There are relatively few children in the center of cities.
2. Across cities, smaller cities have *more* children.
3. In general, there is *negative density dependence* of fertility across French Urban Areas.

## Why Do We Care?


::: {.columns}

<br>

::: {.column width=45%}

#### Housing and Fertility policy may be closer related than previously thought.

* If there is a causal link from house prices to fertility, then...
* ... zoning 🗺
* ... commuting 🚋
* ... labor market 👩🏾‍🎓 👩🏻‍💻 👷🏽‍♂️

are all relevant for 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦


::: 

::: {.column width=45%}

#### Interesting Tradeoff for a planner: where to incentivize fertility?

* Urban Econs emphasize **agglomeration effects**
* Higher density 👉 fewer children
* Where to *locate* parents? (And where other age groups? 👴🏽 👵🏻)

## Problem: Joint Decision

<br>
<br>

Econometrically, that's a mess: People choose location and fertility at the same time. And if not, highly interdependent.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
Either need an exogenous shock to location or fertility:

Forced location (choices)?

Policies *randomly* affecting fertility?
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
Or a credible model.

# 2. Family Networks


---

## Family Networks

* A lot of work (urban and labor) has considered *why* people move.

. . .

* The role of **moving costs** is first order. [One Example. 😬](https://floswald.github.io/publication/option-homeownership-2019/)

. . .

* Surprisingly litte is known about the role of an individual's *family network* in this setting.

. . .

* What is the value of having a family member in a city? Like a person-specific amenity.


---

## Family Networks: Why Do We Care

1. State of the Art models like [Adda, Dustmann + Görlach](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/89/6/2841/6527647) still need to model *other unobserved factors affecting location preference* in a random fashion.

. . .

2. It is an important question to know how those models changes as there are fewer *unobserved* things. How much randomness is left in this model once we account for family network?

. . .

3. Policy: Should we distribute vouchers to people considering moving back to their elderly parents?

. . .

Status: secured PSID confidential access, early stage, stylized facts.

## RA Needs

1. `git`
2. `julia`: immediate need for help with porting [a project](https://floswald.github.io/publication/bankruptcy-2019/) from `v0.6` to `v1.9`
3. `R`: `{data.table}`, `{sf}`

. . .

Basically *everything* one learns in [ScPoProgramming](https://floswald.github.io/ScPoProgramming/) 😉
